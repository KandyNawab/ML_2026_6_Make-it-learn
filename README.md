# CSE623-Machine-Learning-Group-Make-it-Learn
This project focuses on identifying the hard stops and momentory stops from vehicle trajectory data extracted from UAV videos. Using Machine Learning, our group will analyze data such as speed, acceleration and more to identify different stopping pattens.
